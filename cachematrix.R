# The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated.

#makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
#cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

#To run the code
#First make a matrix : mat_in <- matrix(rnorm(9), nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
#source the code file
#built the cache matrix : vec <- makeCacheMatrix(mat_in)
#then call cachemean : cacheSolve(vec)
#call again to use the cached mean
